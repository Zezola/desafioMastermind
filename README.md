<h2>Desafio Mastermind</h2>
Description
Master Mind is a game of code breaking invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz. A “code
maker” chooses a number pattern up to length six. Each number in the pattern can be an
integer from 1 through 6. A “code breaker” then tries to guess the pattern. Feedback is given
after each guess for the count of numbers that are correct and the count of numbers that are in
the correct position. For example if the pattern is 1234 and the guess is 1552 the feedback
given would be: “2 numbers correct, 1 number in correct position”. More examples given
below. The number of guesses is agreed to at the start of the game. The game continues until
the maximum number of guesses is made, or the “code breaker” guesses the pattern.
Your assignment is to program the game of mastermind. The computer program will act as the
“code maker” assigning a random number pattern. Player ( “code breaker” ) will input guesses
until game ends
